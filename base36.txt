Semiconductors possess specific electrical properties. A substance that conducts electricity is called a conductor, and a substance that does not conduct electricity is called an insulator. Semiconductors are substances with properties somewhere between them. ICs(integrated circuits) and electronic discrete components such as diodes and transistors are made of semiconductors. Common elemental semiconductors are silicon and germanium. Silicon is well-known of these. Silicon forms most of ICs. Common semiconductor compounds are such as gallium arsenide or indium antimonide.Semiconductors became essential for many electronic appliances as well as for social infrastructure that support our everyday life.Semiconductors play an important role in equipment control in a variety of fields, such as operating air conditioners at a comfortable room temperature, improving automobile safety, laser treatment in cutting-edge medical care and many more.
