Astronomy is the study of everything in the universe that’s beyond our own planet’s atmosphere. The planets in our own solar system, our own star the sun, and the bright stars can all be seen with the naked eye. However, astronomy can go much deeper, taking advantage of telescopes and other scientific instruments to study other stars and their planets in our galaxy, as well as distant galaxies beyond our own. It can gather clues about the nature of the physical, chemical and biological universe itself. Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences. Early cultures such as the Babylonians performed methodical observations of the night sky, and astronomical artifacts such as Stonehenge have been found from ancient times.
