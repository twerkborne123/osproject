religion describes "the relationship of human beings to what they regard as holy, sacred, spiritual or divine". It is usually accompanied by a set of organised practices which foster a community of people who share that faith. As discussed above, belief is a broader term and it also includes "commitments which deny a dimension of existence beyond this world"
