Mathematics is the science that deals with the logic of shape, quantity and arrangement. Math is all around us, in everything we do. It is the building block for everything in our daily lives, including mobile devices, computers, software, architecture (ancient and modern), art, money, engineering and even sports.Since the beginning of recorded history, mathematical discovery has been at the forefront of every civilized society, and math has been used by even the most primitive and earliest cultures. The need for math arose because of the increasingly complex demands from societies around the world, which required more advanced mathematical solutions.
